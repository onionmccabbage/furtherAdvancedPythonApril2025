Review 4 (Data analysis) carry on until 3:25
========================
Create a new Jupyter Notebook (or a simple python module)
- read in external data (data/flights.csv) into a data frame
  or https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ismayc/pnwflights14/master/data/flights.csv
- show the description
- show the dtypes
- find the mean flight time
‐ Group the data into separate data frames for some airlines (pick a few)

In the flights data set, find:
‐ The number of flight records
‐ The number of unique airlines
‐ How many unique aircraft are represented (tail number)
  for the following decide what we mean by delay
‐ The minimum and mean departure delay for your chosen airlines (or all)
‐ The greatest recorded delay (show the related data)

Optional: Consider how you can address the following challenges:
‐ On average, which airline is the most punctual
‐ Which airline arrives ahead of time most often
‐ Does flight duration appear to affect arrival punctuality more for some airlines than others
‐ Does time of day appear to affect departure punctuality across all flights
‐ Are the standard deviations of flight duration close to the standard deviations of flight distance
- Fimd the mean delay for just the first 50 records in the dataset, 
  then for all delays of 15 or more units

More Optional
Explore the datasets available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
Sign up for free and download a few data sets to analyse
e.g. find statistical relationships between wealth and life expectancy
Show the classic iris data set
Show us what you work with in your own work with data (ML etc)
